## III. More review questions

### III-A. Text

1) Give examples of *constrained writing* techniques

2) What do the following JavaScript methods do?
  - `array.join()`
  - `string.replace()`
  - `string.split()`
  - `string.trim()`
  
3) Give an example of a regular expression *Metacharacter*

4) What are *stop words*?

5) What is a *grammar*?

6) What is the difference between a *terminal symbol* and a *non-terminal symbol*?

7) What happens when we `.expand()` a grammar?


### III-B. ES6 Classes & Modules

1) Let's suppose we have a web service that returns "pet of the day" data in a JSON format. Properties of the JSON include the `species`, `description`, and `url` of the pet:
  - create an ES6 class named `CutePet` that contains these 3 values as properties
  - the class will have a constructor to initialize these values
  - BONUS: create JS setters and getters for this class, and write validation code in the setters that guarantees that these 3 properties will always have a default value
  
  
2) Turn the following code into an ES6 module by making just the `doubleIt()` function "public" and visible from the outside of the file. `SECRET` should be "private" to the file.

```js
// this code in a file named mylib.js

const SECRET = 42;

function doubleIt(num){
  return num * 2;
}
```

### III-C. Node & npm

1) Which JavaScript *engine* does **Node.js** use?

2) Does **Node.js** run on the *client-side*, *server-side*, or *both*?

3) Why doesn't **Node.js** have a `window` object and *DOM manipulation*  methods?

4) Write the line of code that imports a package named `cowsay`

5) What does `npm` allow us to download and manage?

6) What is contained in a *package.json* file?

7) What is *transpiling*?

8) What does the **webpack** package do?

```js
let json = {
  "statusCode": 200, 
  "results": [{"firstName": "Jimmy"},{"firstName": "Johnny"}, {"firstName": "Jilly"}]
 };
 ```

1) Write code that logs out the value of `statusCode` above

2) Write code that loops though all of the `results` above and logs out the value of all the `firstName` properties

3) What is the name of the format of the following data?

dataLoaded({
  "statusCode": 200, 
  "results": [{"firstName": "Jimmy"},{"firstName": "Johnny"}, {"firstName": "Jilly"}]};
});
```

4) Give the HTTP response header than "turns on" CORS so that a web browser can access a web service directly

5) Explain what a *proxy server* does

6) Write code that will access the &lt;city> value below. Assume that this XML is a parseable DOMDocument that is stored in a variable named `doc`:

      RIT
    </title>
    <location>
      <street>
        Jefferson Road
