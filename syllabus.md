## IV. Course Materials and Communication

- most of the course content will be located on this GitHub site
- https://mycourses.rit.edu will contain additional materials, and will also be used for announcements, assignment submissions, and grading
- keep an eye on the dropboxes in mycourses for assignment due dates

**Publisher:** Apple Inc.
Free on web! 
- HTML Version: https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTML-canvas-guide/Introduction/Introduction.html
- See mycourses for the example files

## V. Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early).

## VI. Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Projects (50%)
* Project 1 (25%) - [Audio Visualizer](projects/project-1.md)
* Project 2 (25%) - [MVVM Web Application](projects/project-2.md)


### Exams (30%)
These exams consist of short answer, multiple choice, and "write some code" questions. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
* **Written Midterm Exam**  - will be given the second class meeting of the 8th week of the semester, which is Thursday March 7th (right before spring break)
* **Written Final Exam** - will be given on the last regular class meeting of the semester, which is Thursday April 25th

### Homework (15%)
Completing the HW and in-class exercises is essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one HW assignment per class meeting. Keep an eye on the mycourses dropboxes for the dues dates of these assignments.

Homework and ICEs will NOT be accepted late without a valid excuse (procrastination, and missing the dropbox by 1 minute, are not valid excuses). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor outside of class either by email or during office hours.

**Important!** - When you submit web file(s) (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) to mycourses dropboxes, they (or the folder they are contained in) must be zipped. If you do not do so, mycourses will strip out all of the CSS and JavaScript, and leave you with a non-functioning and ugly web page. Unzipped assignments will therefore usually receive a grade of zero.

### Attendance & Participation (5%)
Note: 1 absence 4/5 points, 2 absences 3/5 points, 3 absences 1.5/5 points, 4 absences 0/5 points. **Each additional absence is 5% off of final average.** Arriving late is 1/2 absence. Facebooking or similar off-task activity during lectures or demos will count as an absence for the day.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed at the end of week 11, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor ASAP as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty. 

### Academic Dishonesty
- The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing or commiting duplicate submission without permission, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: 
[http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html](http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html)
- **Duplicate submission** is the submitting of the same or similar work for credit in more than one course without prior approval of the instructors for those same courses. *If you took IGME-330 previously, you **may not hand** in code that you previously submitted (for example, a previous version Project 1 Audio Visualizer)*

## VII. Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is Tuesday January 22nd, 2019.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Friday April 5th, 2019.
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade. 

## VIII. Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.
