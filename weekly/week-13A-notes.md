# Week 13A - Storing data in cloud

## I. Topics
- [Project 2](../projects/project-2.md) requirements have been posted! The major components of this project are:
  - It "mashes up" two or more web services to do something useful or entertaining
  - It uses an MVVM framework such as Vue.js to update the page, and does NOT do DOM manipulation via methods such as `document.querySelector()`
  - It stores data *locally* via webstorage
  - It stores data in *the cloud* via Firebase
- So the last piece you need to do project 2 is to get some mojo in Firebase - here are the Firebase exercises/demos:
  - [1 - Intro to Firebase](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-1.md)
  - [2 - Firebase Highscore App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-2.md)
  - [3 - Firebase Highscore Viewer](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-3.md)
  - [4 - Firebase "Draw & Share" App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-4.md)
  
**Note:** If you do not follow along and understand what we are doing in these four Firebase chapters, you will have a difficult time meeting the cloud storage requirement of Project 2.
