# Week 14A - Project 2 Work Day

## I. Topics
- Look at Project 2 prototypes
- Troubleshoot Project 2 issues
- Demo how to integrate Vue & Google Maps --> [demo-vue-plus-google-maps.md](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-vue-plus-google-maps.md)

## II. Final Exam Review Resources
- For the final exam, you are allowed a "cheat sheet":
  - it will be a 3" x 5" index card
  - you can write on the front and back of the index card
  - it must be hand-written, and in your own handwriting (because the primary benefit of a cheat sheet is in the time that you spend studying and writing down the material, you often end up learning it and thus don't need the cheat sheet very much)
- The final exam review notes are here --> [Final Exam Review](../exams/final-exam-review.md)
