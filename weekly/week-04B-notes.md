# Week 4B - Canvas Bitmap Effects

## I. Overview
- Today we will look at how to manipulate image data to create simple Photoshop effects like tinting and noise
- To see more advanced effects such as *embossing*, refer to Part II of the Audio Visualizer HW.

## II. Presentation
- [HW - Audio Visualizer - Part II](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-AV-2.md) - and we will take a quick look at the linked webcam demos in class (these files are also in mycourses)
- [Demo - Sprite Literals and Canvas Image Data](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-canvas-image-data.md)
- [HW - Audio Visualizer - Part III](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-AV-3.md) - this is for reference and will help you on Project 1, but we are not collecting it
